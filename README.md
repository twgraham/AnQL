    Another Query Language - simple, no nonsense querying for C#/ASP.NET/TypeScript 
    <br />
</p>

This project is still a work in progress.

A simple query language that can be consumed by a range of targets:

- In memory collections (C# and Typescript)
- Database ORMs (using C# Expressions)
- MongoDB

Example of the query language

```
(first_name: John or first_name: Jane) and age: > 30 and start_date: last year
```
